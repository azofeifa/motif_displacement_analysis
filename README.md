# Analysis of the co-occurrence between TF DNA Binding Motifs and ehancer RNA origins
Hello! This github site contains two things:

  1) A jupyter notebook that takes you step by step through methods and capabilities in the package directory
  2) And of course the actual python package
  
The jupyter notebook along with this code is in large part meant to complement the Azofeifa et al 2016 Paper "Enhaner RNA profiling predicts transcription factor activity"
