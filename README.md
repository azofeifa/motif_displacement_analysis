# Analysis of the co-occurrence between TF DNA Binding Motifs and ehancer RNA origins
Hello! This github site contains two things:

  1) A jupyter notebook that takes you step by step through methods and capabilities in the package directory

  2) And of course the actual python package
  
The jupyter notebook along with this code is in large part meant to complement the Azofeifa et al. 2016 Paper "Enhaner RNA profiling predicts transcription factor activity." Below are some images  that can be easily generated by this package. 

The python dependencies are minimal
  
  1) Numpy  2) Scipy 3) Matplotlib
  
To download the jupyter / ipython notebook software please go to: http://jupyter.org

Please feel free to contact me with errors, bugs or  additional features at joseph[dot]azofeifa[at]colorado[dot]edu
